why new redux based categories slice or module?

earlier, we were getting data and then calling the action-creator function
passing that data to it, 
and dispatching the whole thing to reducer

now we wanna do things differently
we can to get the data also, inside the action creator
also, we wanna handle this a bit professionally by updating the user at every stage
like, fetch start, fetch success, fetch failed, so on .....
